# Malaria Cells Classification using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)



## 1. Objective

The objective of this project is to develop, train and evaluate the performance of a Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) model to classify malaria cells into uninfected or infected classes.  



## 2. Motivation

Malaria remains a major burden on global health, especially in tropical countries, as illustrated in the figure below. Hundreds of millions of blood films are examined every year for malaria, which involves manual counting of parasites and infected red blood cells by a trained microscopist. Accurate parasite counts are essential not only for malaria diagnosis. They are also important for testing for drug-resistance, measuring drug-effectiveness, and classifying disease severity. However, microscopic diagnostics is not standardized and depends heavily on the experience and skill of the microscopist. It is common for microscopists in low-resource settings to work in isolation, with no rigorous system in place that can ensure the maintenance of their skills and thus diagnostic quality. This leads to incorrect diagnostic decisions in the field. For false-negative cases, this leads to unnecessary use of antibiotics, a second consultation, lost days of work, and in some cases progression into severe malaria. For false-positive cases, a misdiagnosis entails unnecessary use of anti-malaria drugs and suffering from their potential side effects, such as nausea, abdominal pain, diarrhea, and sometimes severe complications [1]. 

Recently, the application of machine and deep learning, for the classification of malarial cells has been explored and demonstrated to yield high accuracy [1-8]. In this work, we shall demonstrate such an application. In particular, we design, train and evaluate the performance of the convolutional network (CNN) to classify malarial cells.
